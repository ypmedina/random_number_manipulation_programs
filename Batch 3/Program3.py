#Prog03: Create a program that ask user to input a number, continue asking until the user input is invalid. Display "Unique" after input when the inputted number don't have duplicate. Display "Duplicate" after input when the inputted number have duplicate.
#Make a "while" statement and use "try" and "except" functions to catch invalid inputs
#For the unique and dupes, just use the same technique as the previous programs
